# Task-01: Data Visualization

## Objective

To visualize the distribution of a dataset using bar charts or histograms in order to understand patterns and trends in the data.

## Dataset

World Development Indicators – Population dataset.
The dataset contains population data of different countries across multiple years.

## Data Visualization

A histogram was created to visualize the distribution of population values for a selected year. This helps in understanding how population is distributed across countries.

## Steps Performed

- Loaded the population dataset using pandas.
- Cleaned the dataset by skipping metadata rows.
- Selected a single year column for visualization.
- Created a histogram to represent population distribution.
- Saved the visualization as an image file.

## Output

- Histogram image saved in the `output/` folder.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
